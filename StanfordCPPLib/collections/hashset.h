/*
 * File: hashset.h
 * ---------------
 * This file exports the <code>HashSet</code> class, which
 * implements an efficient abstraction for storing sets of values.
 * 
 * @version 2019/02/04
 * - changed internal implementation to wrap std collections
 * @version 2018/03/10
 * - added methods front, back
 * @version 2016/12/09
 * - added iterator version checking support (implicitly via HashMap)
 * @version 2016/12/06
 * - slight speedup bug fix in equals() method
 * @version 2016/09/24
 * - refactored to use collections.h utility functions
 * @version 2016/08/11
 * - added containsAll, isSupersetOf methods
 * @version 2016/08/10
 * - added support for std initializer_list usage, such as {1, 2, 3}
 *   in constructor, addAll, containsAll, isSubsetOf, isSupersetOf, removeAll,
 *   retainAll, and operators +, +=, -, -=, *, *=
 * - bug fix in hashCode function
 * @version 2016/08/04
 * - fixed operator >> to not throw errors
 * @version 2015/07/05
 * - using global hashing functions rather than global variables
 * @version 2014/11/13
 * - added template hashCode function
 * @version 2014/10/10
 * - removed foreach patch

                 * Hello student! If you are reading this message, it means that you tried to
                 * initialize a HashSet improperly. For example, you might have tried to
                 * write something like this:
                 *
                 *     HashSet<int> mySet = 137; // Oops!
                 *
                 * Here, for example, you're trying to assign an int to a LinkedHashSet<int>.
                 *
                 * or perhaps you had a function like this one:
                 *
                 *     void myFunction(LinkedHashSet<int>& mySet);
                 *
                 * and you called it by writing
                 *
                 *     myFunction(someSet + someOtherSet); // Oops!
                 *     myFunction({ });                    // Oops!
                 *
                 * In these cases, you're trying to pass a value into a function that takes
                 * its argument by (non-const) reference. C++ doesn't allow you to do this.
                 *
                 * To see where the actual error comes from, look in the list of error messages
                 * in Qt Creator. You should see a line that says "required from here" that
                 * points somewhere in your code. That's the actual line you wrote that caused
                 * the problem, so double-click on that error message and see where it takes
                 * you. Now you know where to look!
                 *
                 * Hope this helps!
