/*
 * managed.h
 * ---------
 * This file defines a template class named Managed that can be used to define
 * classes that perform checks on how their objects are allocated.
 * This can be used to write, for example, node classes that give better
 * error messages to the user when double-freed or stack-allocated.
 *
 * @author Marty Stepp
 * @version 2019/05/13
 * - better error output; default false for stack/non-new allocation
 * @version 2019/04/16
 * - bug fixes for WIN64
 * @version 2019/04/13
 * - bug fix for s_freed compiler error
 * - fixed internal includes
 * @version 2018/12/04
 * - initial version
