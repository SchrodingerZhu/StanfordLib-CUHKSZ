/*
 * File: regexpr.h
 * ---------------
 * This file exports functions for performing regular expression operations
 * on C++ strings.  It will be unnecessary once the C++11 regex library
 * is widely available, but as of this writing the regex library is not
 * supported on gcc and other major C++ compilers.
 * 
 * The regular expression functions are implemented by sending the strings and
 * regexes to the Java Back-End to run the operations in Java.  This is a bit
 * kludgy but we don't want to write our own regex parser from scratch.
 * Using Java's is a compromise for now.
